Please use the list below as a working guideline. I recommend copying it or creating your own version, ideally in a format I can also access and follow along with. A good option would be to add a new tab in your existing Set Plan Excel document for this purpose.

I'll be using this list here to track your progress as well. As you work through the items, feel free to update your version, and I’ll mirror any changes here in the thread to keep everything in sync. This way, we can easily monitor what's been completed and what still needs attention.

As a final step, please take a moment to fill out the [RAnews Set Highlight Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmbOr99x7vg95t9Fznp6jgdywlAGGHg6AyVzfOwGPentvIaQ/viewform?usp=preview). In it, you’ll be asked to write a short pitch promoting your game/set, aimed at readers of the RetroAchievements digital magazine. Your snippet may be featured—fully or with minor edits—in an upcoming issue under the **"Junior Developer Program"** section.

Use this as a chance to spotlight what makes the game and your achievement set stand out. It’s a great way to highlight your work and get players excited to check it out! Consider briefly mentioning:
- What the game is about
- What makes the achievement set fun or unique
- Any specific design focus or standout challenges

This isn’t a devlog, just a brief, engaging introduction meant to catch a reader’s attention.

Here are a few examples of past highlights for inspiration:
- [RANews Issue February 2025](https://news.retroachievements.org/issues/2025-02/jr-developer-program.html) (first appearance of this section)
