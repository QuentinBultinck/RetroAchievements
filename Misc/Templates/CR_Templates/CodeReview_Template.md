# ✦═══════✦ 🔑 Misc Prerequisites ✦═══════✦ // TODO

### ❓ Hubs & Similar Games // TODO
Are there any **hubs** you think should be added?
Be sure to review the [RAdocs - Hubs Guidelines](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#common-hubs) for proper usage.
I recommend browsing the full list of hubs via [RAweb - All Hubs](https://retroachievements.org/hubs) to find any relevant matches.

How about **similar games**?
Consider titles from the same series, or games within a similar genre or with shared mechanics.
Be sure to review the section on this matter in [RAdocs - Similar Games](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#similar-games)

If the game includes **multiplayer**, one of the following meta hubs may apply, depending on how the set handles multiplayer functionality:
- [Meta - Set Disallows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/26213)
- [Meta - Set Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/22986)
- [Meta - Set Partially Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7115)

Since Junior Developers don’t have permission to add hubs or similar games directly, please make a list of all that apply, and we’ll handle the additions from there.

### ❓ Game Page Metadata // TODO
/// [RAdocs - Screenshot Dimensions](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#screenshot-dimensions) 
Is everything correctly filled out on the **manage page** and **game page**? (publishers, genre, game screenshots, box art, release date...)
Juniors devs should be able to edit these fields themselves via the `Dev drop down menu` or via the `Manage page`.

# ✦═══════✦📜 Summary & Final Thoughts 📜✦═══════❖ // TODO
/// Overview and high-level review conclusion.  
/// What still needs to be proven or improved?  
/// Was everything from https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/am-i-ready-for-review.html covered?

## ∘───── 📋 TODO Checklist ─────∘ // TODO
- **Initially Posted on**: `DD Month YYYY` - `Initial Code Review`
- **Last Updated on**: `DD Month YYYY` - `Checklist Assessment #0-[ChecklistAssessmentNumber]` // CR_TODO Perform next Checklist Assessment Round

Please use the list below as a working guideline. I recommend copying it or creating your own version, ideally in a format I can also access and follow along with. A good option would be to add a new tab in your existing Set Plan Excel document for this purpose.

I'll be using this list here to track your progress as well. As you work through the items, feel free to update your version, and I’ll mirror any changes here in the thread to keep everything in sync. This way, we can easily monitor what's been completed and what still needs attention.

When the full checklist is completed and confirmed, we can proceed with finalizing the review and begin discussing the set’s promotion. Until then, feel free to ping me anytime if you’ve completed the task list or have further questions, I’ll be happy to review things again when ready.

Alright, we'll be promoting the set, once you're ready. Any achievements marked `[VOID]` will remain in Unofficial.

Please review the **"Achievement News Announcement"** template below, which shall be posted in [#achievement-news in RAdiscord](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/310207383542562816)
- Let me know if the video I’ve provided is okay, else share a link to a more suitable one if you prefer.
- Do you have any flavour text you'd like to include with the announcement? Try to write something that will make players excited to try out your set. You could briefly highlight what makes the game fun or unique, or what kind of experience the achievement set offers.
- Are there any additional links which should be included? Perhaps an RAguide?

Reply/ping me once you’ve looked it over and are ready to promote it!
> ℹ️ **NOTE** — Both of us need to be online at the same time to promote the set. Let me know when you're available so we can coordinate.
> **Here’s how it’ll go**: I will be promoting all achievements to Official. Afterwards you'll need to click the `Complete Claim` button from the `Dev` drop-down menu on the game page, ideally within a reasonable timeframe after the promotion of the set. That’s all there is to it!

#  ✦═══════✦ :kirbyjam: Post-Set Promotion ✦═══════✦ // TODO

## ∘───── ✒️ RANews Set Highlight ─────∘ // TODO
As a final step, please take a moment to fill out the [RAnews Set Highlight Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmbOr99x7vg95t9Fznp6jgdywlAGGHg6AyVzfOwGPentvIaQ/viewform?usp=preview). In it, you’ll be asked to write a short pitch promoting your game/set, aimed at readers of the RetroAchievements digital magazine. Your snippet may be featured—fully or with minor edits—in an upcoming issue under the **"Junior Developer Program"** section.

Use this as a chance to spotlight what makes the game and your achievement set stand out. It’s a great way to highlight your work and get players excited to check it out! Consider briefly mentioning:
- What the game is about
- What makes the achievement set fun or unique
- Any specific design focus or standout challenges
This isn’t a devlog, just a brief, engaging introduction meant to catch a reader’s attention.
