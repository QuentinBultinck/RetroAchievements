# %%%%%%%%%%%%% READY FOR REVIEW %%%%%%%%%%%%% #

# ------Intro_A------

Hello @_JR_DEV_USERNAME_

Your set look pretty polished, but I have a few remarks I'd wish for you to address before we get you into the backlog.

# ------Intro_OK------

Hello @_JR_DEV_USERNAME_

Your set look very solid, I have no remarks to give, everything looks good from my short review of the set. 

# ------Checklist (for CR)------

### 👉 Overal Set Design

# ------Closing Notes------ // TODO

Please do your best to address all of the feedback above. Once you've gone through everything and made the necessary changes, ping me again — I’ll then officially add you to the review backlog.

# %%%%%%%%%%%%% POST-READY FOR REVIEW %%%%%%%%%%%%% # // TODO, once added to the backlog

You've been added to the backlog, so now it's just a matter of waiting your turn. Thanks for your patience — we’ll get to your review as soon as we can.

In the meantime, here are a few suggestions to make the most of the wait:
- (Recommended) Keep testing and polishing your set. The less problems there are discovered during the Code Review, the faster you'll be out of the junior program and earn full dev status.
- (Recommended) See where you can incorporate Measured or Trigger flags for better player feedback.
- (Recommended) Add or improve leaderboards, if applicable.
- (Optional) Revisit any achievements you struggled to implement, fresh ideas may help. 
- (Optional) Add support for an alternate hash if the game has other versions.
- (Optional) Consider writing an [RAguide](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki) to help players understand the set.
- (Optional) Get involved with other parts of the RAcommunity, whether that’s helping other Junior Devs, contributing to the Art Team, Writing Team, Playtesters, RANews or even helping with coding.

Your extra efforts will not only help your own set stand out, they’ll also be a great way to grow as a developer in the community.
