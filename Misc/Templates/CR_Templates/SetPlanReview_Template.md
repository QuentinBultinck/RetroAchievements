# ――――――――――――――――― ℹ️ Optional Considerations ――――――――――――――――― // TODO

This section is `optional` at this stage, but it may prove useful for your growth as a junior developer later on.

### 🚦 Features Usage (Trigger / Measured) // TODO
- Consider using RA’s `Trigger` and `Measured` features where appropriate to provide clearer feedback to players.
- These tools help improve the clarity, functionality, and overall user experience of your achievements.

### 🏁 Leaderboards & Rich Presence // TODO
- Leaderboards are optional but strongly encouraged.
  Refer to [Leaderboards Guide](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/leaderboards.html#leaderboards)
- Rich Presence is **required** before requesting set review down the line.
  Reference: [Rich Presence Guide](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/rich-presence.html#rich-presence)

### 📖 Writing RAguide // TODO
- Consider preparing a RAguide for the [📚 RAguides/Wiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki)



# ✅ Wrap-Up (Set Plan Review)
