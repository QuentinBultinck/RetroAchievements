Hello @_USERNAME_

Hey there! Thank you for your interest in joining the RA Developer Cohorts, and welcome! 

Please take some time to carefully read through all the notes and suggestions outlined below. They’re here to guide you through the process and help set you up for success with your first achievement set.

Once you’ve reviewed everything and made any necessary updates or adjustments, we’ll be ready to move things forward and get you devving in no time!

# ✦═══════✦ 🔍 Set Plan Review ✦═══════✦ // TODO

## 🎓 Development Intentions // TODO, only include this for Jr Dev Requests
/// Ask what their intentions are for joining the program. We are searching for individuals who wan't to become full devs rather than devs that only stay for a little while.

## 🎯 Overal Set Design // TODO
/// Balance, creativity, progression, and content coverage. 

### 👉 Titles // TODO
/// Conform to [RAdocs - Writing Policy](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/writing-policy.html#achievement-titles)
/// Title Case, Copy pasted level names?

### 👉 Descriptions // TODO
/// Conform to [RAdocs - Writing Policy](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/writing-policy.html#achievement-descriptions)
/// Consider [#writing-requests on RAdiscord](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/1100757231294750730)

### 👉 Achievements Types/Labels (progression/missables) // TODO
/// Achievement types: https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/progression-and-win-condition-guidelines.html
Any `missable` achievements? 
> *"Think of a player who only wants to play through the game once to earn the Beaten status, perhaps picking up a few achievements along the way..."*
- If missing an achievement would require replaying a significant portion of the game, it might also warrant the `missable` tag. Of course, if the game includes features like chapter or level select, this concern is largely mitigated.
You're the expert on this game, so this is up to you.

### 👉 Difficulty Balancing // TODO
/// Difficulty balance: [RAdocs - Difficulty Guidelines](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/difficulty-scale-and-balance.html)  

### 👉 Unwelcome Concepts // TODO
/// Unwelcome concepts: [RAdocs - Unwelcome Concepts](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/unwelcome-concepts.html)

### 👉 Point Distribution // TODO
/// Conform to [RAdocs - Achievement Scoring](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/achievement-scoring.html)

### 👉 Challenges & Variety // TODO
/// Enough variation in challenges, are features/game mechanics touched upon?

# ✦═══════✦ ℹ️ Optional Considerations ✦═══════✦ // TODO

> This section is `optional` at this stage, but it may prove useful for your growth as a junior developer later on.

## 🚦 Feature Usage (Trigger / Measured) // TODO
Consider RA’s [Trigger](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/flags/trigger.html#trigger) and [Measured](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/flags/measured.html#measured) features where appropriate to provide players with clearer feedback during gameplay for specific achievements. These features not only improve the achievement experience but also help reduce confusion or frustration during more complex challenges. You could potentially mark these feature on the set plan as well. 

> ### Trigger Indicator
> `"This functionality allows putting indicators on the screen to help players know when a challenge is active, or more importantly, when they fail the challenge."`
>
> A prime example would be for `a damageless boss fight`. A trigger indicator is displayed on screen when the boss fight starts, and is removed from the screen when the player takes damage, giving the player feedback that the challenge has failed, and he has to retry.

> ### Measured Indicator
> `"Measured marks a condition for tracking progress. It adds a progress bar to the achievement overlay to inform the user how close they are to completing an achievement."`
>
> An example would be `collect all coins within a stage`. If there are 9 coins, a measured indicator could keep track of how many are left to collect. This could be done as 0/9 or in %.
> Another example: `Complete stage x, with only 5 allowed ability activations`. This would start at 5/5 and decrement by 1 when an ability is used, giving the player feedback of how many abilities the player is still alowed to use before the achievement fails.

Using these features can significantly enhance the clarity, functionality, and overall user experience of your achievements. These features help players better understand expectations and track their progress or failure of specific achievements in real time.

## 🏁 Leaderboards & Rich Presence // TODO
- Leaderboards are optional but strongly encouraged.
  Refer to [Leaderboards Guide](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/leaderboards.html#leaderboards)
- Rich Presence is **required** before requesting the Code Review down the line.
  Reference: [Rich Presence Guide](https://docs.retroachievements.org/developer-docs/rich-presence.html#rich-presence)

## 🕹️ Multiplayer // TODO, check if multiplayer is a thing for the game
You may want to consider the multiplayer features of this game, within your set.
If the feature is present then make a choice:
> - ❌ **Disallow Multiplayer**
> All achievements must be earned in single-player mode only.
> - ✅ **Allow Multiplayer**
> Achievements must be unlocked during multiplayer sessions. (Achievements aren't allowed to be unlocked with only 1 player doing all the work)
> - ⚠️ **Partially Allow Multiplayer**
> Some achievements may allow multiplayer unlocks, but this can lead to balancing issues or unintended gameplay advantages (e.g., player 2 assisting player 1). Use with caution and document intent clearly.

You may also consider creating a [Subset - Multi], if for example multiplayer content significantly differs from the single-player experience:
- In this case all the [BaseSet] achievements only unlock with only 1 player is interacting with the game.
- The [Subset] achievements only unlock when multiple players are interacting with the game.
This helps maintain balance and clarity while still supporting full multiplayer content.

If the game includes multiplayer features of any kind, you will also have to apply one of the following [Meta] hubs to your set:
- [Meta - Set Disallows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/26213)
- [Meta - Set Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/22986)
- [Meta - Set Partially Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7115)
These hubs help players understand the intended play context of your set, without having to describe it in each achievement's description.

## 📚 Writing RAguide
- Consider preparing a RAguide for the [RAguides/Wiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/guides/wiki)

# ✦═══════✦ ✅ Wrap-Up ✦═══════✦
Before we can move you forward into the Junior Developer Program, please take a moment to address the remarks and suggestions outlined above. These are important to ensure your set plan is solid and ready for the next stage.

Just to clarify, this is the design phase. You don't need to worry yet about whether you can code the achievements; the focus of this short review right now is simply on brainstorming and outlining ideas.

> **Note**: You may skip the **Considerations** section for now, those are not strict requirements for entry into the program. You'll naturally encounter and work through those once you begin actively developing your set.

Once everything is in order, just give us or me another ping, and we’ll proceed with the next steps!
