# ✦═══════✦ 🧠 Memory Work & Internal Notes ✦═══════✦

## ∘───── 🛠️ RAM Digging & Code Notes ─────∘
You've clearly done a thorough job exploring and documenting the game's RAM. The core values needed for achievement development are well noted, and you've even gone beyond that by documenting additional logic, some of which may not directly apply to this set, but could prove useful in future projects. You also added some extra notes where necessary, love to see it!

Even when certain findings don’t immediately translate into achievements, this kind of deep RAM exploration is valuable. It shows strong investigative effort and often leads to unexpected discoveries that can enrich both current and future development work. Great job on the groundwork here, it reflects a solid, methodical approach to memory research.

I do have a few questions though, about some code notes that could perhaps be added some more information, or they were just unclear to me.

### ❓ `$0xbc74` & `0xbc78`
`[16-bit] Screen X-Axis Offset` & `[16-bit] Screen Y-Axis Offset`
Offset to what exactly? The location of the camera within the map?

## ∘───── 🧷 Additional Developer Notes ─────∘
Your initial [Ready for Review Post](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/1373734010965983404) introduced a lot of information on how the set was designed, which was very useful in getting this Code Review started, love to see it!
CR `suspect15`, had some remarks within this thread regarding Rich Presence and hexadecimal values in code notes, seems like all his remarks were handled.

Your initial Set Plan looked well thought out and I see how the design of the set shifted somewhat as you got to developing. 

## ∘───── 🧪 Testing & Debugging Results ─────∘
In your [Ready for Review Post](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/1373734010965983404) you mentioned how you handled testing, very nice to see.

### ❓ Development Questions
I wish to see how your development process went:
- What led you to developing a set for game?
- You seem to support a Russian translation patch for this game, which is very nice to see! Did you run into any issues trying to support this as well? From my Code Review, I assume note, since you didn't use any text-based logic. 
- Have you had any problems whilst RAM digging?
- Did you have to change anything significantly during the development of the set?
- Did you run into any problems whilst developing the set? How did you fix these?

# ✦═══════✦ 🕹️ Achievement Set Design ✦═══════✦

## ∘───── 🎯 Overall Set Design ─────∘

### 👍 Positive Observations
- Good job on splitting up progression and missables/side-objectives.
- I love how you introduced unique challenge achievements for each mission, not just copy pasting them across the board, only having a few re-occuring challenges, love to see this! Challenge achievements like these are what's the most challenging to develop most of the time as well, and they also keep the players on their toes/more engaged as they have to re-think strategies for each unique challenge. Make sure to keep this up in any future sets!
- The challenge achievements come with great usage of measured/trigger flags.
- Overal the set design is exquisite!
- A handful of leaderboards to go with the set, love to see this! 

### ---⇢ 🏆 Achievements ⇠---

### 💡 Suggestion: Add a Trigger Flag to Achievement [Safe Zone Secured](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521056)
`Finish Escape level by killing all enemies and destroying all explosive barrels without dying, in any mode`
So I think adding a trigger flag on lines[34-35] would be interesting. If they were to be added, this would show the player that the measured value of 110/110 kills is achieved, now the only remaining thing to do is finish the mission. Alas this is but a minor thing, but might increase feedback to the player somewhat, of what is requested from them. Do what you think it best here.

### ❓ Multiplayer
I am unfamiliar with how multiplayer works, you mentioned something with a Nintendo Link system? Does this mean multiplayer is just not possible via emulation? Does this mean achievements are not unlockable in multiplayer modes? Do achievements need multiplayer protection? You might want to make a clear stance on this through including one of the following [Meta] hubs to your set:
- [Meta - Set Disallows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/26213)
- [Meta - Set Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/22986)
- [Meta - Set Partially Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7115)
These hubs help players understand the intended play context of your set, without having to describe it in each achievement's description.

### ---⇢ 📺 Rich Presence ⇠---

### ❓ Mission/Level Structure
There seems to be 5 missions, with each mission having multiple levels. In your RP each level is marked with a `xx/15` is this how the game actually displays this? Otherwise I would probably write the RP as something like: 
- `... • Mission 2, Pulling Teeth • Level 2, Escape • ...`
- `... • Mission 2-3, Pulling Teeth - Covering Fire • ...`

This seems the be ordering as found on [MoH:Infiltrator Fandom Wiki](https://medalofhonor.fandom.com/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Infiltrator#Missions):
```
Tiger at the Gates
- The Beachhead
- Deck Gunner
- Air Raid

Pulling Teeth
- Defection
- Escape
- Covering Fire

Thunderbolt
- Break and Cover
- Unexpected Party
- Stealing the Fire

Mousetrap
- Tail Gunner
- Missing in Action
- Lone Wolf

Trail of the Beast
- The Hunt
- Shoot Out
- End Game
```
In the end do what you think feels best here, it's your design.


### ---⇢ 🌐 Leaderboards ⇠---

### ❓ Time Trial Content Coverage?
There seem to be Time Trial leaderboards for only a few of the levels. Please elaborate on why this is, so I can understand how you've thought this through.

## ∘───── ✍️ Titles & Descriptions ─────∘
If any of below remarks prove difficult, you could consider #writing-requests on RAdiscord.
https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/1100757231294750730

### 💡 Suggestion: Titles
All progression and achievements regarding sub-objectives seem rather simple, they're just a copy paste of the mission/level name. I'd advise to be creative here and come up with more creative titles for these, rather than just: `[LevelName]` and `[LevelName] 100%`. Try to think of any backstory or lore regarding the mission, or perhaps a creative quip/qoute mentioned somewhere for this war which it's inspired by... 

Some idea's for mission 1, The Beachhead:
- The Landing
- Fire on the Sand
- Boots on the Sand
- Opening Salvo

For the side-objective completion, you could incorporate something about the side-objectives themselves. For mission 1, The Beachhead, the player has to destroy an ammunition cache and find some dessert-map intel:
- Secured & Searched
- No Stone Unturned
- Blown Stock & Stolen Secrets
- The Beach Beneath

In the end it's up to you, what you do with this, but writing, especially the title is a large part of how the player first experiences/engages with your set. A higher quality set would not just copy-paste level names.

> *"There’s a saying about a janitor who keeps everything spotless, yet no one notices, because that’s the point. The place looks great because someone took pride in doing their job well. It’s a reminder that high-quality work often goes unseen, but it speaks for itself through the results."*
> 
> In this case: writing does NOT go unnoticed, the achievement text and the badge art are the first things a player experiences/engages/sees/reads when first playing your set. So the higher the quality on this, the better.

### ❗ Brackets/Parentheses in Descriptions
Please refer to [RAdocs - Writing Policy: Brackets/Parentheses](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/writing-policy.html#brackets-parentheses).
I personally dislike seeing `[Campaign]` in the achievement descriptions. It would be of higher quality to see full sentences. I advise doing something like:

- Complete Mission 1 - Tiger at the Gates: The Beachhead, in Campaign Mode.
- In Campaign Mode, complete Mission 1 - Tiger at the Gates: The Beachhead

- In Campaign Mode, complete Mission 1, Tiger at the Gates: The Beachhead, with all side-objectives completed
- Finish Mission 1, Tiger at the Gates: The Beachhead, with every side objective completed in Campaign Mode.
- Finish Mission 1, Tiger at the Gates: The Beachhead, in Campaign Mode, completing all side objectives.

### ❓ Achievement [Symphony of Destruction](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521077) "Within 3 Seconds"
I've tested this achievement since it wasn't straightforward how the logic functioned exactly. I discovered that the timer of 3 seconds starts when the player throws/uses the explosive/secondary weapon. The current description isn't exactly clear on when the timer of 3 seconds starts. I'd advise something like:
`On The Hunt level, use a grenade to take out four enemies and four explosive barrels within 3 seconds of throwing it, in any mode`

My guess is that this timer of 3 seconds if implemented to make sure the 8 kills acquired were the result of one grenade throw and not some other weapon.

### 💡 Suggestion: Mission/Level Structure in Descriptions
I feel like it also reads/feels weird seeing `Complete Mission 1 - Tiger at the Gates:...` in three achievements. Why am I completing mission 1 thrice? But it's actually 3 seperate levels within mission 1. This is again the problem with Mission/Level structuring as mentioned in your RP design.

This also may be an issue within your leaderboard descriptions, just make sure it's consistent, when you make any changes.

I would try to find another method of describing this, perhaps something like:
- Complete "The Beachhead" level in Mission 1, "Tiger at the Gates"
- Complete Tiger at the Gates - The Beachhead
- Complete Mission 1, Level 1: The Beachhead
- Complete Level 1-1: Tiger at the Gates, The Beachhead
- Complete Level 1, "The Beachhead" in Mission 1, "Tiger at the Gates"

## ∘───── 🖼️ Badge Art ─────∘
The badges are of high-quality, love to see them! 

### ❓ Art Credits
Were all achievements badges and the Mastery badge made by you? This question is in regards to adding the correct credits via the Manage page.
It seems you were already credited for the Mastery/Game badge, but I don't see any art credits for the achievement badges yet. This is also done via the Manage page, but I'm unsure if juniors have access to this.

## ∘───── ⚖️ Point Distribution ─────∘
The set scores an average points of `7,8`, which is near the average of `7`, love to see it!

### ❓ 50-Pointer Difficulty 
The current 50-pointer achievement [Medal of Honor](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521084), for completing the game in one sitting on Max-GI Mode is a beast of a challenge, in the best way possible! It’s great to see a truly demanding achievement that rewards mastery.

That said, I’d like to raise a small design consideration:
Is it truly necessary to include the "without dying" condition?

If the mode itself already restricts or punishes death (eg. no lives), then the condition might be redundant. On the other hand, if the mode does allow some margin for error, it might make more sense, and feel more fair, to reframe the requirement as:
- “Complete without losing all lives”
- or “Complete while losing no more than X lives”

This would still maintain the difficulty and prestige of the 50-pointer while being more accessible to dedicated players.

Ultimately, it depends on how the game handles lives in Max-GI Mode. If you're confident the current condition best represents the mode's difficulty and design, feel free to keep it, just consider whether a slight tweak might strike a better balance.

# ✦═══════✦ ⚙️ Technical Implementation ✦═══════✦

### 👍 Positive Observations
- The achievement logic looks excellent, you've demonstrated a strong and varied use of the toolkit. It’s clear you chose a game that lends itself well to exploring the full range of development features. Designing challenge-based achievements is often the most difficult part of set creation, but also the most rewarding in terms of learning and skill-building. Great work on tackling those! (I do have a few questions, see below)
    - Very smart usage of SubSource
    - Lots of PauseLocks with ResetNextIfs or AltResetGroups
- Rich Presence logic looks good. (A few suggestions, see below)
- Leadeboard logic looks good. (Although one remark, see below)

## ∘───── 🧩 Achievement Logic ─────∘

### ❓ Achievement [Lock and Load](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521045) "Without using Mounted Machine Gun"
```
  9: OrNext      Mem   8-bit 0x0001073c !=  Value       0          (0)
 10: PauseIf     Mem   8-bit 0x0001079c >   Value       0          (50)
```
In a few of your achievements, I noticed you're using a PauseIf with a HitCount of 50 to detect certain things, like when the player is using a Mounted Machine Gun or when the sound alarm is active.
Could you elaborate on the reasoning behind using HitCount 50 specifically? From a technical standpoint, wouldn’t a HitCount of 1 already be sufficient to pause the achievement logic as soon as the condition is true? You could even add a delta check in that case together with when the flag changes from false to true.
In achievement [Lock and Load](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521045) using a higher HitCount like 50 seems to introduce a delay in the PauseIf condition, which might open up a small window where a player could switch back to the Thompson loadout before the achievement disables. That creates some ambiguity in the logic’s intent.

It’s a minor point overall, but I’d appreciate your thoughts on why this setup was chosen, especially if it was for stability, to avoid false positives, or if there’s another edge case in mind. Just want to make sure I fully understand the design reasoning here.

### ❓ Achievement [Anyone Else?](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521074) PauseIf Logic
Please elaborate on why you're also checking if `[PlayerHealth] > 1` within this PauseIf clause. I assume this may have something to do with checking if the player is in-game? It's a rather minor thing, I just want to see what you design choice is here.
```
  9: AndNext     Mem   8-bit 0x00019ca4 >   Value       1          (0)
 10: PauseIf     Mem   8-bit 0x00019ca4 <   Value       99         (1)
```

### 💡 Suggestion: Achievement [Self-Sustained](https://retroachievements.org/achievement/521079) Logic
Current logic:
```
  9: AndNext     Mem   8-bit 0x0001081c =   Value       1          (0)
 10: OrNext      Mem   8-bit 0x00010818 =   Value       59         (0)
 11: ResetNextIf Mem   8-bit 0x0000b7f4 !=  Value       255        (0)
 12: AndNext     Mem   8-bit 0x000127c5 >   Value       1          (0)
 13: OrNext      Mem   8-bit 0x000127c5 >   Delta 8-bit 0x000127c5 (1)
 14: PauseIf     Mem   8-bit 0x000127c5 <   Value       50         (1)
```
Your current ResetNextIf logic resets the PauseIf condition `when not in-game` OR `when the level timer hits a specific value`. I'd recommend refining that second part, instead of checking if the timer hits an exact value, consider checking if the level timer exceeds a certain threshold (eg. `passes XX seconds`).

I assume your intent is to allow the player to retry the challenge upon restarting the level, and using the timer to detect a reset point makes sense. However, when working with timers, it's generally safer to avoid exact-value checks. Due to emulation quirks or rare frame skips, the timer might occasionally skip specific values, which could lead to the reset not triggering as expected.

You could implement suggested logic by using a mem/delta check on time. This would ensure that the reset still happens even if the timer skips the precise moment you’re checking for.
Of course, if your current logic works reliably in testing, it’s not strictly incorrect, but this tweak adds a helpful safety net for edge cases and something you should be wary of whenever working with timers.


## ∘───── 🔧 Rich Presence Logic ─────∘

### 💡 Suggestion: Add More Requirements/Clauses to the Conditional RP Display Strings
All may function correctly, but some of your conditionals only reference one RAM address. I'd advise to add some more conditions/requirements, especially to the survival mode RP string, just for safety. Like adding a check to see if not at MainMenu for example. What I do is often have negative requirements to other modes. For example: `Mode X is true AND thus mode Y is false AND MainMenu false...` or `Demo is true AND in-game false`

### 💡 Suggestion: Default RP Display String
For your default display string you have `In the menus`, perhaps something that would be more broad could be more intersting here since you already have a conditional for being at MainMenu.
I'd suggest something as basic as `Playing Medal of Honor: Infiltrator` or perhaps something with flavour text: `Earning medals with honorable infiltration` or some other cheesy/funny quip idk, this is up to you, it's a rather minor thing, but it's just a slight little extra small detail, you know that most players won't even notice... 

> I'm mentioning this again: 
> *"There’s a saying about a janitor who keeps everything spotless, yet no one notices, because that’s the point. The place looks great because someone took pride in doing their job well. It’s a reminder that high-quality work often goes unseen, but it speaks for itself through the results."*

## ∘───── 🔢 Leaderboard Logic ─────∘

### ❗ CANCEL Missing Delta Checks
Your CANCEL groups may work as intended, but it's always good practice to aim having delta checks wherever it's possible, even for something as arbitrary as a CANCEL group.
You could make them as simple as:
```
Delta   In-game == true
Mem     In-game == false
```
Alas the more conditions you add the more robust it will be as well, but sometimes simplicity is fine as is. I'd asvise to at least add these delta's there as well.

# ✦═══════✦ 🔑 Misc Prerequisites ✦═══════✦

### ❓ Hubs & Similar Games
There are more hubs, which could be added to this game. I recommend browsing the full list of hubs via [RAweb - Hubs Central](https://retroachievements.org/hubs) to find any relevant matches.
Be sure to review the [RAdocs - Hubs Guidelines](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#common-hubs) for proper usage.

How about **similar games**?
Consider titles from the same series, or games within a similar genre or with shared mechanics. This list should be limited to 5-6 entries, whilst aiming to have to least 1-2.
Be sure to review the section on this matter in [RAdocs - Similar Games](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#similar-games)

If the game includes **multiplayer**, one of the following meta hubs may apply, depending on how the set handles multiplayer functionality:
- [Meta - Set Disallows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/26213)
- [Meta - Set Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/22986)
- [Meta - Set Partially Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7115)

Since Junior Developers don’t have permission to add hubs or similar games directly, please make a list of all that apply, and we’ll handle the additions from there.

### ❓ Game Page Metadata
Is everything correctly filled out on the **manage page** and **game page**? (publishers, genre, game screenshots, box art, release date...)
Juniors devs should be able to edit these fields themselves via the `Dev drop down menu` or via the `Manage page`.

It also seems the gameplay screenshot on the **game page** has the incorrect size. It's `290x174`, while it should be `240x160` for Game Boy Advance games. Refer to [RAdocs - Screenshot Dimensions](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/game-info-and-hub-guidelines.html#screenshot-dimensions)

## ∘───── 📚 Final Thoughts ─────∘

Overall, this set is genuinely impressive and crafted with clear intent. I haven’t found any critical issues, and the core logic appears solid. There are a few minor areas that could benefit from refinement: missing delta checks in the leaderboard CANCEL groups, some inconsistencies in achievement descriptions (eg. bracket usage), and a few logic patterns that could be simplified or made more robust. Also some missing metadata for this game.

None of these are blockers, but addressing these details will elevate the set from great to exceptional. You're of course welcome to counter any suggestions, especially if you have a clear rationale, that's part of the dev process.

Please use the list below as a working guideline. I recommend copying it or creating your own version, ideally in a format I can also access and follow along with. A good option would be to add a new tab in your existing Set Plan Excel document for this purpose.

I'll be using this list here to track your progress as well. As you work through the items, feel free to update your version, and I’ll mirror any changes here in the thread to keep everything in sync. This way, we can easily monitor what's been completed and what still needs attention.

## ∘───── 🌟 Set Promotion ─────∘ // TODO, only include this section, when not promoted to full dev
/// Guide junior through set promotion + ask to review "Achievement News Announcement" template
///
/// Steps to Promoting the Set:
/// --------------------
/// 1. CR: Click `Complete Review Claim` button in `Dev` drop-down menu
/// 2. Jr: Click `Complete Claim` button in `Dev` drop-down menu
/// 3. CR: Post **"Achievement News Announcement"** on their behalf
/// 4. Update status of set in [Jr-Dev-Proficiency Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xeVscMX1eCllDAHXEHOUcORxyGUgC0jySDc28KHY6o8/edit?gid=1669062073#gid=1669062073)

Alright, we'll be promoting the set, once you're ready. Any achievements marked `[VOID]` will remain in Unofficial.

Please review the **"Achievement News Announcement"** template below, which shall be posted in [#achievement-news in RAdiscord](https://discord.com/channels/310192285306454017/310207383542562816) once the set goes live.
- Let me know if the video I’ve provided is okay, else share a link to a more suitable one if you prefer.
- Do you have any flavour text you'd like to include with the announcement? Try to write something that will make players excited to try out your set. You could briefly highlight what makes the game fun or unique, or what kind of experience the achievement set offers.
- Are there any additional links which should be included? Perhaps an RAguide?

Reply/ping me once you’ve looked it over and are ready to promote it!
> ℹ️ **NOTE** — Both of us need to be online at the same time to promote the set. Let me know when you're available so we can coordinate.
> 
> **Here’s how it’ll go**: I will be promoting all achievements to Official. Afterwards you'll need to click the `Complete Claim` button from the `Dev` drop-down menu on the game page, ideally within a reasonable timeframe after the promotion of the set. That’s all there is to it!
> 
> After that, I’ll post the **"Achievement News Announcement"** on your behalf. Once that’s done, I’ll leave one final comment in the Code Review thread asking for an RAnews Set Highlight snippet. I’ll explain this more when we get to that point.
