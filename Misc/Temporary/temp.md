:white_check_mark: Achievement Count
Very well—if you feel all of the game’s content is covered and there's enough challenge variety, then that’s fair.

:white_check_mark: Achievement Description Formatting
Your updated descriptions look good.
Yes, many older sets haven’t been updated to match the current guidelines yet. It’s our shared responsibility as devs to gradually bring everything up to standard—this is a community effort.

:white_check_mark: Challenge Achievement Variety
Understood—if this is all the game offers in terms of meaningful variation, then that’s what it is.

:white_check_mark: Multiplayer Requirement
Unique challenges are always great to see—nicely done. Before your set goes live down the line, make sure to clarify your stance on multiplayer eligibility using one of the following Meta tags:
- [Meta - Set Disallows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/26213) (This would then require proper achievement logic to check against multiplayer)
- [Meta - Set Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/22986)
- [Meta - Set Partially Allows Multiplayer](https://retroachievements.org/hub/7115)

:white_check_mark: Ghost Tap
Ah, so that’s how it functions—very well.
Good call checking how other sets approached this. Shows strong initiative and research effort.

Closing Thoughts
You’ve clearly taken the time to process the feedback thoroughly and have demonstrated a solid understanding of the game. Your responsiveness and attention to detail reflect a good mindset for set development.
It’s also evident that you’re eager to contribute meaningfully to the RAproject. Everything looks in order from my side, and I believe you're ready to move forward.

@maintainer — I’ll leave the final steps to you.
