# Set Plan Review

Hello @_USERNAME_

I have some remarks regarding your set design plan. 

### ðŸ‘‰ Titles // TODO
// Title Cased
// Copy pasted level names?
Title look fine

### ðŸ‘‰ Descriptions // DONE
I think you've already read up on this [RAdocs - Brackets/Parentheses](https://docs.retroachievements.org/guidelines/content/writing-policy.html#brackets-parentheses).
If possible, it's often requested that you don't use any parentheses in descriptions, it looks less professional. Alas, do what you think is best. I think it's fine imo.

### ðŸ‘‰ Point Distribution // TODO
I think most of the achievement are scored very well.

### ðŸ‘‰ Achievements Types/Labels (progression/missables) // TODO
**Missables**
I don't think you're using this label correctly, you've put them onto challenge achievement which I feel don't necessarily need them. Elaborate on your choice if you think it's best to keep them there.

### ðŸ‘‰ Challenges & Variety // TODO
I have looked at some video's of the game, there seems to be a few features or gameplay mechanics which might not be touched upon in your achievement list.

- Strength Power-up & Hammer upgrades 
> You have 1 achievement for this I think it's `Collect a hammer upgrade.`
> I think something like `Collect a total of xx power-ups and finish the stage` could be interesting
> Perhaps there could be collection achievements for gathering all power-ups in a stage

- Highscore
> You have one achievement for this. But I think you could make some more concepts with this. 

- Attack Methods?
> Are there any special methods for killing enemies besides swinging or tossing?
> You try to incorporate them into the challenge achievements.

**Variety**
Try to make each challenge achievement unique in a way. Over the stages, I see a lot of returning challenges. This makes every challenge feel kinda the same, making it more testing musclee memory. If you're able to make each achievement as unique as possible, with as little repetition as possible, I think that would be better design. Having some repition here and there is fine, but I feel like it's overdone in your set plan. Try to mix gameplay/seperate challenges together into one big one. 

My suggestion would be the following:
Extend the challenges `Complete xx stage on Hard difficulty` with a few idea's like:
 `Complete xx stage on Hard difficulty, without tossing the hammer`, `Complete xx stage on Hard difficulty, killing only the boss`, `Complete xx stage on Hard difficulty, killing all enemies` or `Complete xx stage on Hard difficulty, within xx time`

# Considerations
### ðŸ”¶ Features Usage (Trigger/Measured) // TODO
Consider using the Trigger/Measured features of RA's achievement toolkit for any achievement you deem necessary, especially if you consider any collection achievements or specific challenges.

### ðŸ”¶ Leaderboards & Rich Presence // TODO
Leaderboards easily fit the games design. Make sure to design them once you get that far down the line. 
Rich Presence is a requirement before you put the set into review state, down the line. So thinking about this is advised.
