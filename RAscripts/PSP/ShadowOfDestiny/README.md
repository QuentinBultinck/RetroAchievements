[![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Images/092240.png "Mastery badge icon")](https://retroachievements.org/game/3945 "Retro Achievements game page - Shadow of Destiny (PSP)") 

This guide explains how to unlock each achievement in the core set of the PSP version of Shadow of Destiny.


#### Walkthroughs & Resources
If the explanation here doesn't suffice feel free to search up some guides, here are a few helpful resources:

+ [Shadow of Destiny (PSP) - game page on Retro Achievements](https://retroachievements.org/game/3945 "Retro Achievements game page - Shadow of Destiny (PSP)") 
+ [Fandom Wiki - Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny](https://shadowofmemories.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_of_Memories_Wiki "Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny - Fandom Wiki")
+ [Youtube Guides - Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny](https://www.youtube.com/@shadowofmemorieswiki/videos "Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny - Wiki Youtube account")
+ [FAQS, guides & walkthroughs - Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/553882-shadow-of-destiny/faqs "FAQS, guides & walkthroughs - Shadow of Memories/Shadow of Destiny")

#### General tips for unlocking the achievements in this set
+ If an achievement is related to a cutscene, try not to skip. This should only be a problem if you're replaying the game, since you can't skip if you haven't seen the cutscene yet. Would be preferable to start from a whole new save file if possible.
+ Fast forwarding with emulator tools is allowed and should still trigger the achievements.
+ Some achievements can be skipped once the triggered popup is shown on screen. The corresponding achievement for the cutscene will unlock once the cutscene is skipped or is done. [^triggered]
