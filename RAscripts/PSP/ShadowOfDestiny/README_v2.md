#### General tips for unlocking the achievements in this set
+ If an achievement is related to a cutscene, try not to skip. This should only be a problem if you're replaying the game, since you can't skip if you haven't seen the cutscene yet. Would be preferable to start from a whole new save file if possible.
+ Fast forwarding with emulator tools is allowed and should still trigger the achievements.
+ Some achievements can be skipped once the triggered popup is shown on screen. The corresponding achievement for the cutscene will unlock once the cutscene is skipped or is done. [^triggered]
