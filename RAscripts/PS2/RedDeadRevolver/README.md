#### General information and tips for unlocking the achievements in this set
+ All achievements are single player focused, even the ones for the multiplayer mode, *Showdown*. A potential real multiplayer subset could easily be made if there's enough ask for it, or if another developer wants to create one (most of the necessary RAM has been code noted).
+ All achievements will be disabled when using cheats, unless stated otherwise. Make sure no cheat is active in the *Cheat Menu* prior to restarting or starting the required mission for the achievement. (The Cheat Menu is part of the Pause Menu and is accessible once a cheat has been unlocked via Bounty Hunter Mode.)

    üèÜ Showdown Challenges <i><sub><sub>(12)</sub></sub></i>
</h2>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - All of these multiplayer/Showdown challenge achievements require solo play. Thus when using a second controller, the achievement will not trigger.
> - A trigger indicator will be shown on the showdown menu/at the main menu when all required settings for a showdown achievement are correct. This trigger indicator will hide once the loading screen starts or when any settings are incorrect. Although this trigger indicator is not necessary to have been displayed for the achievement to be unlocked. Only the trigger indicator which is shown during the match is of importance.
> - When a trigger indicator is displayed on the post-match overview menu, the player has completed the Showdown challenge. Pressing OK to display a new window should unlock the correpsonding achievement.
> - **GAME BUG**: The trigger indicator shown when setting up the Showdown match at the main menu may not display properly when shifting through the showdown stages too fast <sub>(the ID which checks for the selected showdown stage may not update properly when shifting through the stages too fast...)</sub> To make the trigger indicator appear properly, just don't shift through the showdown stages too quickly. Although as mentioned above as well. This trigger indicator is not necessary to have been displayed.
