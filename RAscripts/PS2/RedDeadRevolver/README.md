These missions usually have a follow-up finale mission with a dedicated reward menu. Thus you'll have to complete that mission as well |

This gun is found in a crate in a small dead-end passage to the west (check the map of this level). Save the bullets for the boss fight. <br><br> - During most of the fight, Grizzly has very high defense against your damage. However, when Grizzly stops on one of the pillars and starts throwing knives, he becomes vulnerable to massive damage. Aim for headshots during this moment to conserve ammunition; otherwise, you may run out and need to retry the achievement. <br><br> - The fastest way to retry this achievement is to let your HP drop to 0, allowing you to restart from the checkpoint just before the boss. Restarting the mission via the pause menu will take you back to the beginning of the mission <br><br> - An RAtrigger popup is shown during the fight. If you damage him with anything else other than the firearm 'Faith', the RAtrigger popup will be removed, informing you of failure. <br><br> - Once Grizzly is defeated, the achievement should unlock once the reward menu is displayed |
