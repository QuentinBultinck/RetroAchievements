#### Essential Info & Tips

+ info_and_tip

+ Due to the nature of this prototype build, the player character may easily get stuck on objects or go out of bounds when struck by enemy attacks, as these can push the character model into unintended areas. This might prevent progress on certain achievements. However, a simple level *Reset* via the *Pause Menu* can quickly give the player another chance. Since the levels aren’t very large, this shouldn’t be too much of a hassle.

    🏆 Single Player Progression <i><sub><sup>(__count__ achievements)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

The achievements in this category require the player to visit in all levels which feature "significant" content. While only half of the levels meet this criterion, don’t worry—mastering this set will still require the player to visit all levels. For more details, refer to the achievement categories: [Single Player Challenge Achievements](#c_SPChallenge) and [Single Player Bonus Achievements](#c_SPbonus)

> [!NOTE]
> ***"Beaten"* Status**: Since all levels in the LevelSelectionMenu are unlocked by default, no achievement is tied to a *"Win Condition"*.
Therefore, to achieve the *"Beaten"* status for the game on the RetroAchievements site, the player must unlock all achievements under this category, marked as *"Progression"*.

However, since this is a prototype build, there may not be any text displayed. The achievement will unlock once this interaction activates and as long as [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is still active. <br><br> If *"Jiji"* doesn’t approach the player, he may be stuck somewhere. Try walking around to get close to him and trigger the interaction. If he remains unresponsive, he may have gone out of bounds due to enemy attacks—most likely from Pig Josh’s dynamite explosions. <br><br> To reach 15 kills, the player must eliminate at least one Piggy twice. Piggies are the small flying enemies that spawn alongside Pig Josh and will continue respawning until he is defeated (these are the only enemies which keep respawning in this level). However, once Pig Josh dies, all remaining Piggies will despawn. To meet the kill requirement, the player should reach at least 14/15 kills before taking down Pig Josh, as his defeat will count as the final required kill. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Old Man *"Jiji"* dies. <br> - The player picks up a healing item. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when any of the fail conditions are met. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **15** |
