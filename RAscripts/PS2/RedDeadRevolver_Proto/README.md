Set consists of 34 achievements worth 167 points

Set released on DD MMMM YYYY
```

This set is primarily designed to showcase everything this build of *Red Dead Revolver* has to offer. As well as some secret/hidden features which did not make it to the full release. It should be a fairly quick and easy to *"master"* this achievement set.

<h4 id=WalkthroughsResources>
    Walkthroughs & Resources
</h4>

If the explanation here doesn't suffice feel free to search up some guides, here are a few helpful resources:

+ [Retro Achievements Game Page](https://retroachievements.org/game/32806 "Retro Achievements Game Page - Red Dead Revolver (Prototype)") 

As this is a prototype build. This game isn't well documented anywhere at all. The best resource would probably be this RAguide, the RA forum topic of this game or the comment sections on the game page.

#### Essential Info & Tips

+ Due to the nature of this prototype build, the player character may easily get stuck on objects or go out of bounds when struck by enemy attacks, as these can push the character model into unintended areas. This might prevent progress on certain achievements. However, a simple level *Reset* via the *Pause Menu* can quickly give the player another chance. Since the levels aren‚Äôt very large, this shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a hassle.

+ There are a few game bugs which may crash the game, alas this build doesn't use any save system. So no progress may be lost and the stages/levels are pretty short, so any crashes are minimal in achievement progress.

    üèÜ Single Player Progression <i><sub><sup>(5 achievements - 25 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

The achievements in this category require the player to visit all levels which feature combat encounters. While only half of the stages in this prototype build meet this criterion, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîmastering this set will still require the player to visit all stages. 
For more details, refer to the achievement categories: [Single Player Challenges](#c_SPChallenge) and [Single Player Bonus Achievements](#c_SPbonus)

> [!NOTE]
> ***"Beaten"* Status**: Since all stages in the LevelSelectionMenu are unlocked by default, no achievement is tied to a *"Win Condition"*.
Therefore, to achieve the *"Beaten"* status for the game on RetroAchievements, the player must unlock all achievements within this category. Thus all achievements marked as *"Progression"*.

    üèÜ Single Player Challenges <i><sub><sup>(5 achievements - 50 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This category encompasses a set of custom-made challenge achievements. There's at least one for each stage, which has combat encounters.

> #### Developer Note
> I wanted to design at least one challenge achievement which incorporated some sort of accuracy stat. eg. *"Complete xx Stage with xx% accuracy"*. But because of limitations with the current development tools this idea was canned.

| Title <sub><sup><i>(dev_id)</i></sup></sub> | Guidance & Insights |
|:---:|---|
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeTng>**Whack-a-Mole**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeTng*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | Within the **"Training Stage"**, eliminate **11** moles during the **Shooting Challenge**, in **under one minute** and whilst only going for **headshots**. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Hitting a bodyshot <br> - Failing to kill 11 moles within the time limit of 60 seconds. (The Shooting Challenge fails in this case)<br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*.</sub>  <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the Shooting Challenge starts. It is removed when the player hits a bodyshot <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of mole kills up to **11** <br><br> <sub> **WARNING ‚ÅÉ** *Each mole kill adds \$2.00 to the player's cash. When this cash value reaches above \$49.09 the game goes into a "Win State", resulting the level to reset. Thus this will fail the player's current progress for this achievement. (Also refer to achievement [a_WinGame](a_WinGame)).* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengePerf>**No Harm Comes Home**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengePerf*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Prologue Stage"**, defeat a total of **six** hostile NPCs, **without taking damage**. Interact with **Mother** or **Jinnie** after the deed is done to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Taking damage <br> - Both Jinnie and Mother have died before being able to a receive "Thank You" message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*.</sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts, this indicator is removed when the player takes damage. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of enemies killed, up to **six**. <br><br> <sub> **Warning ‚ÅÉ** *"Billy The Kid" may be spawned in as a friendly NPC when the player manages te kill "Ugly Chris" too fast, before "Billy" can spawn. This would prevent this achievement from unlocking.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeHng>**Lead with Precision**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeHng*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Title Stage"**, defeat a total of **six** hostile NPCs, **without missing a single shot**. Once all enemies are eliminated, talk/interact with the **dog, *"Rusty"***, to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Missing a shot <br> - The dog dies before being able to receive the message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when at 100% shot accuracy. This trigger may also dissapear for a few frames/milliseconds while the game is still tracking flying bullets/shots. If they all land, the indicator should re-appear. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **six**. |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeShernite>**Reckoning at Midnight**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeShernite*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Sheriff Night Stage"**, complete the following within 2 minutes: defeat a total of **seven** enemies, then talk/interact with the captive to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Timer passes 2 minutes. <br> - The captive dies before being able to receive his "Thank You" message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when 2 minutes have passed. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **seven**. |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeSher70>**Sheriff by Sunrise**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeSher70*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | Eliminate at least **15** hostiles during the **"Sheriff Day Stage"** without picking up any healing items AND ensuring that the neutral NPC, **Old Man *"Jiji"***, survives so the player can receive a **"Thank You"** message from him. <br><br> Once Pig Josh is defeated and Jiji survives, he will run up to the player, triggering a brief interaction or cutscene. However, since this is a prototype build, there may not be any text displayed. The achievement will unlock once this interaction activates and as long as [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is still active. <br><br> If *"Jiji"* doesn‚Äôt approach the player, he may be stuck somewhere. Try walking around to get close to him and trigger the interaction. If he remains unresponsive, he may have gone out of bounds due to enemy attacks‚Äîmost likely from Pig Josh‚Äôs dynamite explosions. <br><br> To reach 15 kills, the player must eliminate at least one Piggy twice. Piggies are the small flying enemies that spawn alongside Pig Josh and will continue respawning until he is defeated (these are the only enemies which keep respawning in this level). However, once Pig Josh dies, all remaining Piggies will despawn. To meet the kill requirement, the player should reach at least 14/15 kills before taking down Pig Josh, as his defeat will count as the final required kill. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Old Man *"Jiji"* dies before being able to receive his "Thank You" message. <br> - The player picks up a healing item. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when the player receives healing. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **15**. |

It can be executed in Singleplayer and also by any character in Multiplayer.  <br><br> <h4>~~Fail Conditions~~</h4> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the character animation is active. Finish the whole animation to unlock the achievement. <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This is a neat secret character animation which the player can activate.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_SpinFire>**High Noon Hurricane**</h3><br><sub>*a_SpinFire*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | When **in-game**, land at least **three** shots while performing a **Spinfire** special move. This move can only be activated when the player has the **single revolvers** or the **dual revolvers** equipped. <br><br> To perform a Spinfire, the player needs to have any of the two mentioned weapons equipped AND still have leftover special gauge meter left. This special meter bar seems to be used by *special moves* as well as *Rapid Fire Mode* (refer to achievement [a_DeadEyeMaster](#a_DeadEyeMaster) for more on *Rapid Fire*). Then when the player presses both X and O simultaneously, the player character will perform the special move. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> <br> - The player fails to land 3 shots within a single Spinfire. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by doing another Spinfire move. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the special move starts. This indicator is removed when the fail condition is met.  <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of landed shots within a single Spinfire up to three <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This is a neat secret move which the player can activate, not used within the full release. It's not explained anywhere in-game on how to execute a special move. I found this completely by chance. Some other special moves are found in Multiplayer Mode.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_HorseCover>**Low Profile Rider**</h3><br><sub>*a_HorseCover*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | When in-game and use a horse as cover. <br><br> To perform this, the player has to be on horseback. One can be found in the *"Train Stage"*, *"Sheriff Night Stage"* and in the *"Tombstone Stage"*. Once on horseback simply press and hold X and move the camera to the left or right of the horse. <br><br> <h4>~~Fail Conditions~~</h4> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the horse cover animation is active. Hold this animation for 2-4 seconds in order to unlock the achievement. <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This achievement showcases a "secret" prototyped horse cover system, which never made it to the full release.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_SaloonThrow>**Boots First, Questions Later**</h3><br><sub>*a_SaloonThrow*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Saloon Stage"**, **throw** all **two** NPCs outside the front door of the saloon. <br><br> The player can kick enemies by pressing X or R1 whilst standing close to an enemy when in aim mode. The player can also grab and throw enemies. <br><br> The best method to achieve this is to grab and hold an enemy towards the door and then throw and/or kick him towards the door. If the players aims the throw/kick well, the enemy will fly through the front doors. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - The player managed to throw one of the NPCs out-of-bounds, which is not outside the front side of the saloon. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks how many enemy NPCs the player has thrown outside the front door up to two. <br><br> <sub> **Developer Note 1 ‚ÅÉ** *The player has to throw both NPCs outside the front wall of the saloon, not specifically the front door. The achievement checks the y-coordinate of each NPC.* </sub> <br> <sub>**Developer note 2 ‚ÅÉ** *This achievement was primarily designed with the goal to showcase kicking, throwing and grabbing enemies.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_HorseTomb>**The Tombstone Stampede**</h3><br><sub>*a_HorseTomb*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Tombstone Stage"**, **ram** into all **eight NPCs** roaming around town, whilst **on horseback**. A horse can be found in the center of the town. The player can mount the horse by standing next to it and pressing the jump button *O*. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Using/firing a weapon. <br> - An NPC dies whilst the player is not on horseback. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the player is on horseback. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of unique NPCs rammed with the horse, up to **eight**. <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *Whilst playing around with this prototype, I saw the player was able to damage NPCs when ramming into them while on horseback. Thus this achievement was born.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_DeadEyeMaster>**Six-Shooter Symphony**</h3><br><sub>*a_DeadEyeMaster*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | When **in-game**, land at least **five** shots in **one single Rapid Fire Burst**. <br><br> To perform a* Rapid Fire Burst*, the player has to activate *Rapid Fire Mode*. To activate *Rapid Fire Mode*, the player has to be in aim mode, then the player needs to perform an half circle motion with the left analog joystick. Once the aiming reticle changes and Red starts painting targets, the player has activate *Rapid Fire Mode*. Once it is active, simply paint enough targets and press the Fire button. <br><br> Now be wary that *Rapid Fire Burst* is not 100% accurate. It's advised that the player uses the **dual revolvers** as this has a max of 12 bullets, thus 12 targets which can be painted whilst in *Rapid Fire Mode*. Simply paint as much targets as possible and shoot. I would also advise doing this during the **Shooting Challenge** of the **"Training Stage"**, as there are a lot of easy enemy targets to paint. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Failure to land 5 shots within a single *Rapid Fire Burst*. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by performing another *Rapid Fire Burst*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the *Rapid Fire Mode* is active. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks how many shots have hit an enemy up to 5. <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This achievement showcases a unique and different Deadeye ability, which is also in the full release, although in an albeit easier to use version. In the prototype this was called "Rapid Fire", in the full release game this is called "Deadeye".* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_WinGame>**Overflowing Coffers**</h3><br><sub>*a_WinGame*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | Within a **Singleplayer level** earn more than **\$49.09** in cash. This should only be achievable in the **"Training Stage"** or in the **"Sheriff Day Stage"**, as these levels have respawning enemies. The other levels do not have enough enemies to kill to get earn more than \$49.09. <br><br> <h4>~~Fail Conditions~~</h4> <br> <h4>~~Achievement Tracking~~</h4> <br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This achievement showcases some sort of "Win State" the developers put inside this build of the game. Once the player reaches above \$49.09 in cash, the player receives an insane amount of cash and the game goes into a "Win State". After a few seconds the game resets the level.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_EyeShootHng>**Revolver's Rain**</h3><br><sub>*a_EyeShootHng*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/00000.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Title Stage"**, eliminate **five** enemies with the **single revolver** and whilst standing on top of a building. <br><br> This can be any of the two buildings or the tent. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - The player drops from the building. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu* or climb back up if the stage still has enough enemies left to kill. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the player is inside a viable area to eliminate enemies.

<h1 id=c_MPchallenge>
    üèÜ Showdown Challenges <i><sub><sup>(6 achievements - 35 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This prototype build of *Red Dead Revolver* includes a basic version of the Multiplayer Mode, referred to as *"Showdown"*, which is also featured in the full release version. All achievements in this category are centered around this mode.

> [!NOTE]
> **Multiplayer is disallowed** for this set! In other words: playing with more than 1 human player is not allowed. All achievements in this category need to be earned by playing versus CPU. 
>
> All multiplayer achievements require to win a few rounds **"consecutively"**. This means the player must acquire a number of round-wins, one after another without losing any rounds in between.
>
> Pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu* will reset the progress of the multiplayer achievements. It will reset the current number of consecutive round-wins.

> #### Developer Note
> These achievements are rather simplistic, but alas, it's what this prototype offer.
> I wanted to design at least one achievement which incorporated some sort of accuracy stat. eg. *"Win xx multiplayer rounds consecutively with xx% accuracy"*. But because the game never saved a stat for *shotsHit* in Multiplayer, this was canned. It only saves shotsFired in Multiplayer.
