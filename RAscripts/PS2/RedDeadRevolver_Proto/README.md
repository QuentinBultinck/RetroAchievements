Set consists of 35 achievements worth 177 points

Set released on DD MMMM YYYY
```

This set is primarily designed to showcase everything this build of *Red Dead Revolver* has to offer. As well as some secret/hidden features which did not make it to the full release. It should be fairly quick and easy to *"master"* this achievement set.

<h4 id=WalkthroughsResources>
    Walkthroughs & Resources
</h4>

If the explanation here doesn't suffice feel free to search up some guides, here are a few helpful resources:

+ [Retro Achievements Game Page](https://retroachievements.org/game/32806 "Retro Achievements Game Page - Red Dead Revolver (Prototype)") 

As this is a prototype build, this game isn't well documented anywhere at all. The best resource would probably be this RAguide, the RA forum topic of this game or the comment sections on the game page.

#### Essential Info & Tips

+ Due to the nature of this prototype build, the player character may easily get stuck on objects or go out of bounds when struck by enemy attacks, as these can push the character model into unintended areas. This might prevent progress on certain achievements. However, a simple level *Reset* via the *Pause Menu* can quickly give the player another chance. Since the levels aren‚Äôt very large, this shouldn‚Äôt be too much of a hassle.

+ There are a few game bugs which may crash the game, alas this build doesn't use any save system. So no progress may be lost and the stages/levels are pretty short, so any crashes are minimal in achievement progress.

+ Some characters in Multiplayer mode will bug out the game. eg. Character *"Soldier"*. The game will display an error message and freeze when loading the Multiplayer match. Simply retry/reset/reboot the game to try again. You just have to be lucky the other CPU players don't pick any of the bugged out characters.

    üèÜ Single Player Progression <i><sub><sup>(5 achievements - 25 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

The achievements in this category require the player to visit all levels which feature combat encounters. While only half of the stages in this prototype build meet this criterion, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîmastering this set will still require the player to visit all stages. 
For more details, refer to the achievement categories: [Single Player Challenges](#c_SPChallenge) and [Single Player Bonus Achievements](#c_SPbonus)

> [!NOTE]
> ***"Beaten"* Status**: Since all stages in the LevelSelectionMenu are unlocked by default, no achievement is tied to a *"Win Condition"*.
Therefore, to achieve the *"Beaten"* status for the game on RetroAchievements, the player must unlock all achievements within this category. Thus all achievements marked as *"Progression"*.

Mother is supposed to run to the player, once all enemies are killed, to start the interaction. If the NPC doesn't move to the player, she may be stuck. Jinnie won't do this. The player will have to stand next to her, facing her and then interact with her by pressing X or O to start the interacton. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Jinnie or Mother die before receiving their "Thank You" message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by resetting the level via the Pause Menu. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks how many unique allied NPCs have thanked the player up to two. <br><br> <sub> **Warning ‚ÅÉ** *"Billy The Kid" may be spawned in as a friendly NPC when the player manages te kill "Ugly Chris" too fast, before "Billy" can spawn.

The friendly/allied NPC is supposed to run to the player, once all enemies are killed, to start the interaction himself. If the NPC doesn't move to the player, he may be stuck. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - The dog dies before receiving the **"Thank You"** message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by resetting the level via the Pause Menu </sub> <br><br> <h4>~~Achievement Tracking~~</h4> <br><br> <sub> **Misc note 1 ‚ÅÉ** *The shopkeeper starts without a weapon, although he can still be shot.

    üèÜ Single Player Challenges <i><sub><sup>(6 achievements - 60 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This category encompasses a set of custom-made challenge achievements. There's at least one for each stage, which has combat encounters.

> #### Developer Note
> I wanted to design at least one challenge achievement which incorporated some sort of accuracy stat. eg. *"Complete xx Stage with xx% accuracy"*. But because of limitations with the current development tools this idea was canned.

### Single Player Challenge Achievement List

| Title <sub><sup><i>(dev_id)</i></sup></sub> | Guidance & Insights |
|:---:|---|
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeTng>**Whack-a-Mole**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeTng*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568079.png "Achievement badge icon") | Within the **"Training Stage"**, eliminate **11** moles during the **Shooting Challenge**, in **under one minute** and whilst only going for **headshots**. <br><br> Try to aim high on their heads for the headshot to count. For some reason, if the player hits a mole close too low on the head, it won't be counted as a "headshot", but they'll still die in one shot, just like a normal "headshot". It seems like the hitbox for it to count towards a "headshot" is different than the hitbox for a one shot kill. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Hitting a bodyshot <br> - Failing to kill 11 moles within the time limit of 60 seconds. (The Shooting Challenge fails in this case)<br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*.</sub>  <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the Shooting Challenge starts. It is removed when the player hits a bodyshot <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of mole kills up to **11** <br><br> <sub> **WARNING ‚ÅÉ** *Each mole kill adds \$2.00 to the player's cash. When this cash value reaches above \$49.09 the game goes into a "Win State", resulting the level to reset. Thus this will fail the player's current progress for this achievement. (Also refer to achievement [a_WinGameAny](a_WinGameAny)).* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengePerf>**No Harm Comes Home**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengePerf*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568080.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Prologue Stage"**, defeat a total of **six** hostile NPCs, **without taking damage**. Interact with **Mother** or **Jinnie** after the deed is done to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Taking damage <br> - Both Jinnie and Mother have died before being able to a receive "Thank You" message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*.</sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts, this indicator is removed when the player takes damage. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the number of enemies killed, up to **six**. <br><br> <sub> **Warning ‚ÅÉ** *"Billy The Kid" may be spawned in as a friendly NPC when the player manages te kill "Ugly Chris" too fast, before "Billy" can spawn. This would prevent this achievement from unlocking.* </sub> |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeHng>**Lead with Precision**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeHng*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568081.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Title Stage"**, defeat a total of **six** hostile NPCs, **without missing a single shot**. Once all enemies are eliminated, talk/interact with the **dog, *"Rusty"***, to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Missing a shot <br> - The dog dies before being able to receive the message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when at 100% shot accuracy. This trigger may also dissapear for a few frames/milliseconds while the game is still tracking flying bullets/shots. If they all land, the indicator should re-appear. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **six**. |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeShernite>**Reckoning at Midnight**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeShernite*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568077.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Sheriff Night Stage"**, complete the following within 2 minutes: defeat a total of **seven** enemies, then talk/interact with the captive to receive a **"Thank You"** message. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Timer passes 2 minutes. <br> - The captive dies before being able to receive his "Thank You" message. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when 2 minutes have passed. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **seven**. |
| <h3 id=a_ChallengeSher70>**Sheriff by Sunrise**</h3><br><sub>*a_ChallengeSher70*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568078.png "Achievement badge icon") | Eliminate at least **11** hostiles during the **"Sheriff Day Stage"** without picking up any healing items AND ensuring that the neutral NPC, **Old Man *"Jiji"***, survives so the player can receive a **"Thank You"** message from him. <br><br> Once Pig Josh is defeated and Jiji survives, he will run up to the player, triggering a brief interaction or cutscene. However, since this is a prototype build, there may not be any text displayed. The achievement will unlock once this interaction activates and as long as [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is still active. <br><br> If *"Jiji"* doesn‚Äôt approach the player, he may be stuck somewhere. Try walking around to get close to him and trigger the interaction. If he remains unresponsive, he may have gone out of bounds due to enemy attacks‚Äîmost likely from Pig Josh‚Äôs dynamite explosions. <br><br> To reach 15 kills, the player must eliminate at least one Piggy twice. Piggies are the small flying enemies that spawn alongside Pig Josh and will continue respawning until he is defeated (these are the only enemies which keep respawning in this level). However, once Pig Josh dies, all remaining Piggies will despawn. To meet the kill requirement, the player should reach at least 14/15 kills before taking down Pig Josh, as his defeat will count as the final required kill. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Old Man *"Jiji"* dies before being able to receive his "Thank You" message. <br> - The player picks up a healing item. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when the player receives healing. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks the current player's kill count up to **11**. |
| <h3 id=a_WinGameChallenge>**It Always Was About the Money**</h3><br><sub>*a_WinGameChallenge*</sub> <br><br> ![Achievement badge icon](https://i.retroachievements.org/Badge/568261.png "Achievement badge icon") | In the **"Sheriff Day Stage"** collect over \$49.09 in cash in under **four** minutes AND **without picking up any healing items**. <br><br> Each kill is worth \$2 and the player starts at \$10. To reach over \$49.09, the player has to eliminate about 20 enemies in total. The stage comes with 11 non-respawning enemies and 3 *Piggy* enemies which keep respawning infinitely once Pig Josh appears. These are the small flying enemies that throw knives at the player. They keep repsawning as long as *Pig Josh* is alive. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - The player picks up a healing item. <br> - The timer reaches 4 minutes. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the level starts. It is removed when the player receives healing OR when the timer runs out. |

This move can only be activated when the player has the **single revolver** or the **dual revolvers** equipped. <br><br> To perform a Spinfire, the player needs to have any of the two mentioned weapons equipped AND still have leftover special gauge meter left. This special meter bar seems to be used by *special moves* as well as *Rapid Fire Mode* (refer to achievement [a_DeadEyeMaster](#a_DeadEyeMaster) for more on *Rapid Fire*). Then when the player presses both X and O simultaneously, the player character will perform the special move. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - The player fails to land 3 shots within a single Spinfire. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by doing another Spinfire move. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the special move starts.

It's advised that the player uses the **dual revolvers** as this has a max of 12 bullets, thus 12 targets which can be painted whilst in *Rapid Fire Mode*. Simply paint as much targets as possible and shoot. I would also advise doing this during the **Shooting Challenge** of the **"Training Stage"**, as there are a lot of easy enemy targets to paint. <br><br> <h4>Fail Conditions</h4> - Failure to land 5 shots within a single *Rapid Fire Burst*. <br> <sub>If any fail condition is met, the player can easily retry the achievement by performing another *Rapid Fire Burst*. </sub> <br><br> <h4>Achievement Tracking</h4> - A [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is displayed when the *Rapid Fire Mode* is active. <br> - A [Measured Indicator](#RA_Measured) tracks how many shots have hit an enemy up to 5. <br><br> <sub>**Developer note ‚ÅÉ** *This achievement showcases a somwhat different Deadeye ability from the full release, although in an albeit harder to use version.

<h1 id=c_MPchallenge>
    üèÜ Showdown Challenges <i><sub><sup>(6 achievements - 35 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This prototype build of *Red Dead Revolver* includes a basic version of the **Multiplayer Mode**, referred to as **"Showdown"**, which is also featured in the full release version. All achievements in this category are centered around this mode.

> [!NOTE]
> **Multiplayer is disallowed** for this set! In other words: playing with more than 1 human player is not allowed. All achievements in this category need to be earned by playing versus CPU. 
>
> All multiplayer achievements require to win a few rounds **"consecutively"**. This means the player must acquire a number of round-wins, one after another without losing any rounds in between.
>
> Pressing *Reset* in the *Pause Menu* will reset the progress of the multiplayer achievements. It will reset the current number of consecutive round-wins.

> #### Developer Note
> These achievements are rather simplistic, but alas, it's what this prototype offer.
> I wanted to design at least one achievement which incorporated some sort of accuracy stat. eg. *"Win xx multiplayer rounds consecutively with xx% accuracy"*. But because the game never saved a stat for *shotsHit* in Multiplayer, this was canned. It only saves shotsFired in Multiplayer.
