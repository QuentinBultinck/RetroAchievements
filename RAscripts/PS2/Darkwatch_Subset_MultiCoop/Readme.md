## 📜 Co-op Participation Tracking 
### How It Works

In this multiplayer cooperative subset, achievements are designed to unlock only if both players are actively contributing throughout a given Chapter. To promote fairness and teamwork, a participation tracking system is in place. This system monitors each player's engagement and disables achievement unlocks for the Chapter if it detects inactivity or a lack of contribution from one of the players.

Any achievement that requires completing a Chapter from start to finish in a single session will only unlock if both players meet the following criteria:

### Participation Requirements:
> #### No Inactivity Over 30 Seconds
> - Each player must remain active—if any player goes 30 consecutive in-game seconds without input, achievements for the current Chapter will be disabled. (All inputs are checked except Start/Select.)
>
> #### Minimum Gameplay Input Count (30–100)
> - Players must provide a minimum number of valid gameplay inputs (depending on Chapter length). Analog sticks and Start/Select are excluded to prevent idle movements from counting.
>
> #### Combat Participation
> - 5–10% of Total Kills: Each player must contribute at least a small share of the total kills.
> - 10–50 Shots Fired: A basic level of offensive engagement is required.
> - 5–10% Accuracy: Encourages players to aim and not fire randomly.
>
> The exact values for each requirement scale based on Chapter length—longer Chapters demand slightly more input and involvement.

### Why Is This System in Place?

This participation check exists to prevent "freeloading"—where one player does all the work while the other remains idle. Since RetroAchievements has specific guidelines for multiplayer subsets, active participation from all players is a requirement to ensure the integrity of the achievement.

This system ensures that achievements are earned cooperatively, reflecting the effort of both players working as a team.

The zero-point achievement ([a_INFOcoop](#a_INFOcoop)) is included in the set to inform players of this system and ensure everyone is aware of the co-op participation rules.
