## 📜 Co-op Participation Tracking 
### ➤ How It Works

In this multiplayer cooperative subset, achievements are designed to unlock only if both players are actively contributing throughout a given Chapter. To promote fairness and teamwork, a participation tracking system is in place. This system monitors each player's engagement and disables achievement unlocks for the Chapter if it detects inactivity or a lack of contribution from one of the players.

Any achievement that requires completing a Chapter from start to finish in a single session will only unlock if both players meet the following criteria:

### ➤ Participation Requirements:
#### ▹ No Inactivity Over 30 Seconds
- Each player must remain active—if any player goes 30 consecutive in-game seconds without input, achievements for the current Chapter will be disabled. All inputs are checked except Start/Select (not during cinematics or when paused). This 30-second timer is halted during cinematics OR when an in-game menu is displayed. The timer is reset when pressing *Restart* OR when loading another ChapterSection.

#### ▹ Minimum Gameplay Input Count (20–70)
- Players must provide a minimum number of valid gameplay inputs (depending on Chapter length). Analog sticks and Start/Select are excluded to prevent idle movements from counting. (Inputs are not counted when in a cinematic or when paused)

#### ▹ Combat Participation
- 5–10% of Total Kills: Each player must contribute at least a small share of the total kills.
- 10–50 Shots Fired: A basic level of offensive engagement is required.
- 5–10% Accuracy: Encourages players to aim and not fire randomly.

The exact values for each requirement scale based on Chapter length—longer Chapters demand slightly more input and involvement.

### ➤ Why Is This System in Place?

This participation check exists to prevent "*freeloading*"—where one player does all the work while the other remains idle. Since RetroAchievements has specific guidelines for multiplayer subsets, active participation from all players is a requirement to ensure the integrity of the achievement.

This system ensures that achievements are earned cooperatively, reflecting the effort of both players working as a team.

#### Essential Info & Tips

+ Due to how the game's continue system works for Coop Mode (details [below](#retrying-chapter-specific-achievements)), all achievements regarding the completion of specific Chapters, will require the players to complete them from start to finish within one session.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### ➤ Retrying Chapter specific achievements
> - Restarting via the *PauseMenu* can only be used to retry the achievement if the player is still within the first ChapterSection.
> - The only other way to retry these achievements is by replaying the entire Chapter from the beginning through the *MainMenu*. However, be aware that if a Chapter was quit while the player was not in the first ChapterSection, choosing "Continue" from the *MainMenu* will place them at the start of the last active ChapterSection, thus not the beginning of the chapter.
> 
> These achievements require the player to complete the entire Chapter in a single uninterrupted session, from start to finish. Because of this, it's strongly recommended to finish all chapters first, then create a backup of your memory card. This way, players can reinsert a fully completed Co-op Mode save and replay any chapter from the beginning as needed.
>
> A **ChapterSection** is a distinct segment of a chapter, separated by a loading screen. For example, Chapter 3, **"Boneyard"**, contains three sections. If players quit during the second section (e.g., inside the Church Catacombs), continuing from Chapter 3 via the *MainMenu* will resume the game at the start of that section, thus not the Chapter's beginning.
>
> ### ➤ When do Chapter specific achievements trigger?
> All achievements related to completing a specific Chapter from start to finish within one session, will unlock once the loading screen starts. But only if the [Trigger Indicator](#RA_Trigger) is still active.

<h1 id=c_StoryEnd>
    🏆 Story Endings <i><sub><sup>(2 achievements - 50 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These two win conditions achievements encompass the two different endings which can be acquired within the Coop Story Mode.

> [!TIP]
> If you’ve already completed the story once, the best/fastest way to unlock the other ending is to restart from Chapter 14, **"Showdown"**, and make the opposite moral choice at the end. This decision, made after the boss fight in **"Showdown"**, determines which ending you’ll receive at the conclusion of the game.

<h1 id=c_Challenge>
    🏆 Challenges <i><sub><sup>(17 achievements - 170 points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

A set of custom-made challenge achievements for Coop Story Mode, one for each Chapter. Most of these are variations of the same challenges found in the base set, with added Coop support.

### Powers Tiers Explained
Since some challenge achievement descriptions refer to power tiers, and the game itself doesn’t explicitly use the word “tier” to describe powers, I’ve outlined below what I mean by “power tiers” for clarity:

| Tier | Powers |
|:---:|---|
| 1 | **Silver Bullet** & **Blood Frenzy** |
| 2 | **Fear** & **Turn** |
| 3 | **Mystic Armor** & **Black Shroud** |
| 4 | **Vindicator** & **Soul Stealer** |
