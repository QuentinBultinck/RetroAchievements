    üèÜ Story Progression <i><sub><sup>(16 achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These achievements are tied to the completion of the Single Player Story Chapters. These can also be unlocked in Gunslinger Mode.

> #### Developer Note
> All achievements in this category only require players to start and complete the final ChapterSection of a specific chapter. This is due to how the continue system works in Single Player Mode.
>
> *Restarting* via the in-game PauseMenu, always respawns the player at the start of the current ChapterSection, regardless of Single Player or Gunslinger Mode.
>
> A ChapterSection is a distinct part of a Chapter, separated by a loading screen. For example, Chapter 3, *"Boneyard"*, consists of three sections. If a player quits during the second section (within the Church Catacombs), they can resume from the start of that section when continuing the Single Player Story Mode later.

<h1 id=c_SPend>
    üèÜ Story Ending <i><sub><sup>(2 achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These achievements are tied to the two different endings in Single Player Story Mode. They are restricted to Single Player Mode because using Gunslinger Mode to replay the final Chapter would bypass key story moments.

If you‚Äôve already completed the story once, the best way to unlock the other ending is to restart from Chapter 14, **"Showdown"**, and make the opposite moral choice at the end. This decision, made after the boss fight in **"Showdown"**, determines which ending you‚Äôll receive at the conclusion of the game.

> [!WARNING]
> These two Single Player achievements can **NOT** be unlocked in Gunslinger Mode, unlike the [Story Progression achievements](#c_SPstory), which can be earned in Gunslinger Mode. The reason for this is mentioned above.

    üèÜ Singleplayer/Gunslinger Challenges <i><sub><sup>(_COUNT_ achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>

> [!WARNING]
> For these achievements, the player must complete a specific chapter from start to finish in a single session‚Äîwithout quitting. In SinglePlayer Mode (non-Gunslinger Mode), exiting the game midway through a chapter and resuming later will invalidate the challenge.
> 
> However, in Gunslinger Mode, this restriction doesn‚Äôt apply, as the player always starts from the beginning of a chapter. In regular SinglePlayer Mode, progress carries over between sessions, allowing players to continue from their last checkpoint, which is why quitting midway is not allowed for these achievements.

<h1 id=c_Unlocks>
    üèÜ Gunslinger Concept Art Unlocks <i><sub><sup>(15 achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This achievement category focuses on unlocking all *concept art* available in the *ExtrasMenu* at the *MainMenu*. Most pieces are tied to built-in Gunslinger challenges, but the game does not provide a way to view these challenges or their unlock conditions. Without guidance, players would need to rely on third-party resources to figure them out. These achievements serve as an alternative by not only showcasing the *concept art* but also clearly outlining the requirements to obtain them.

Additionally, these achievements can still be unlocked even if the corresponding *concept art* has already been obtained on the active Player Profile. Simply replay and complete the required Chapter while meeting the necessary objectives to earn them.

### Accuracy Statistic
If an achievement/unlock requires a minimum accuracy target, the RetroAchievements overlay will always display a Measured Indicator showing the player's current accuracy.

#### How does the game measure *accuracy*?
- Every shot fired from any weapon counts as *"one shot"*, this includes a shot from a shotgun for example, melee attacks are excluded from this.
- Special weapons like the Rail Rocket, Crossbow, and throwable explosives also count as *"one shot"*, but only when their explosive effect triggers. If an enemy is hit within the explosion radius, it counts as *"one successful hit"*, increasing the accuracy stat accordingly.

> #### Developer Note
> Gunslinger Mode always starts from the beginning of a Chapter, unlike Single Player Mode, where the player can resume a Chapter from their last Checkpoint/ChapterSection in a previous session. Therefor most of the achievements in this category always check if the the first ChapterSection is started from the beginning AND the last ChapterSection is started from the beginning AND the Chapter ends.
>
> *Restarting* via the in-game PauseMenu, always respawns the player at the start of the current ChapterSection, regardless of Single Player or Gunslinger Mode.
>
> A ChapterSection is a distinct part of a Chapter, separated by a loading screen. For example, Chapter 3, *"Boneyard"*, consists of three sections. If a player quits during the second section (within the Church Catacombs), they can resume from the start of that section when continuing the Single Player Story Mode later.
