<h1 id=c_SPstory>
    üèÜ Story Progression <i><sub><sup>(16 achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

These achievements are tied to the Singleplayer Story Chapters, but can also be unlocked in Gunslinger Mode.

> #### Developer Note
> All achievements in this category only require players to complete the final section of a specific chapter. For example, Chapter 3, *"Boneyard"* consists of three sections separated by a loading screen. If a player quits during the second section, they can resume from that sections beginning when continuing Single Player Story Mode at a later time.
> Therefor these achievements only track whether the last section of a chapter was started from the beginning and successfully completed.

    üèÜ Concept Art Unlocks <i><sub><sup>(_COUNT_ achievements - _XX_ points)</sup></sub></i>
</h1>

This achievement category focuses on unlocking all concept art available in the Extras Menu at the Main Menu. Most pieces are tied to built-in Gunslinger challenges, but the game does not provide a viewable list of these challenges.
