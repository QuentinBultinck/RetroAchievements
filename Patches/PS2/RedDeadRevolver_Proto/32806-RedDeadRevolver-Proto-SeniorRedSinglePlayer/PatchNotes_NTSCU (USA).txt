|| Patch Notes - SeniorRed SinglePlayer ||
==========================================
- By default this prototype build loads CharacterModel "training red (trd)" for all SinglePlayer Levels.
    This patch changes this so it loads "new red (nrd)" instead
- The game has 4 different CharacterModels for the main protagonist, Red. 
    I tried looking for a way to make the 4 different CharacterModels for Red work across the different levels, 
    where it would make sense (eg. TrainingStage loads "trd", TitleStage loads "nrd"), but this is impossible due to how this build is coded. 
    Implementing something like this would pretty much mean creating a hack of this build by adding/changing a significant amount of code. But this is too far fetched for me.

----- List Red CharacterModels 
----- FullName      (CharacterModelID)      Description
    - training red  (trd = 0x747264)    --> Teen Red
    - snow red      (yrd = 0x797264)    --> Teen Red with different (warmer) jacket
    - red           (red = 0x726564)    --> Senior Red without a long coat
    - new red       (nrd = 0x6E7264)    --> Senior Red with long coat, as seen on trailers and TitleScreen
