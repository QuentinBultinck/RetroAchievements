Darkwatch (PAL) - PlayStation 2
. This file details how to transform below hacks/cheats/patches for PCSX2 into ROMpatches (xdelta patches)
. Also contains some general notes regarding the patches
. These patches are translated from NTSC-U into PAL
. RAMaddresses according to rcheevos/RAIntegration/RALibretro RAM mapping

- 60 FPS Hack, by asasega (https://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-60-fps-codes?pid=550050#pid550050)
...............................................................................................

Notes - FPS patch:
- Using only the FPS patch results in 50 FPS, from 25 FPS

Notes - Widescreen patch:
- Using Widescreen patch on PAL, activates NTSC 60Hz mode, instead of PAL 50 Hz mode. --> NTSC mode @ 30 fps || PAL mode @ 25 fps
- Combining FPS patch with Widescreen patch on PAL version, results in 60 FPS
- Widescreen patch, results in both playerCharacterModels in Multiplayer Cooperative mode to become Jericho, instead of the default Darkwatch Regulator Models
--- This has probably something to do with loading in a higher resolution texture/model pack. As by default, this mode has very low resolution on textures
